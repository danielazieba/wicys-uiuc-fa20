## Web Security Part 1 code:

Things to download:
- Node.js 12.x

To run the code:
- Open two terminals on your machine
- Type ```node my-server.js``` to run the server in one terminal
- Type ```node my-client.js 8000``` to run the client in the other terminal

It should be a basic TCP client and server, where the client is able to poke the server and get some data returned to it.
